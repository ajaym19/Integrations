Create a GIT Repo in GITHUB
Open terminal and navigate t your project


Steps:
1. GIT Init: initializae your project with git >> git init >> now you git is initialized for your peoject
2. GIT Add remote origin: now we need to paste the below code coped from github website and hit enter
	git remote add origin https://github.com/ajaym19/Integrations.git
	git remote add origin {this is the path of your repo}
3. Use git status command to check the status of the code been merged, red means not merged
4. use git add .  >> this will give you the changes to be commited
5. use git commit -m "message here"   >> this will commit your code but yet not pushed on server
6. use git push origin master
	But it may give error when we push 
	so to push you need to have ssh public key
	Generate public key for your account/machine
		use ssh-keygen -t rsa command
		enter yes
		enter system password
		use pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to copy ur ssh in clip board.
		
	go to setting in github website of your account
		create new SSH Key
		and enter this ssh key over there and create
		
		
		
To get a project from git to our system
1. get the project link from github
2. create a dir in ur systm using mkdir 
3. use git clone path_of_the_github_project
4. to get new update, dont clone again,just navigate to the project and use git pull origin master

To create a new Branch
	1. use git branch "branchname"
	2. use git checkout "branchname" - now all changs will go to new branch
	3. perform some changes and commit using below steps
		3. Use git status command to check the status of the code been merged, red means not merged
		4. use git add .  >> this will give you the changes to be commited
		5. use git commit -m "message here"   >> this will commit your code but yet not pushed on server
		6. use git push origin "branchname"
	4. Finally merge the new branch into master using git merge "branchame"
		But before merge, u need to checkout master using git checkout master
	5. then also push the master changes git push origin master
	6. delete the branch if you need git branch -d "branchname"  -- this will delete only locally not github
	7. to delete from remote also git push origin --delete "branchname"
